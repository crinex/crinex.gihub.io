                    Meta-learning equips models with the ability to learn from scarce examples, akin to human learning, through episodic sampling, where models tackle a series of small, diverse tasks requiring rapid adaptation. Within each episode, two key processes unfold: the inner loop, where the model fine-tunes its parameters to the specific episode for immediate task performance, and the outer loop, where it generalizes this learning across episodes to enhance future task adaptability by updating its initial learning parameters. 
                    <br> 
                    Gradient Based Meta Learning (GBML), solves each episode with gradient descent. Which means, it solves episode within few optimization steps.

                <div class="text-justify">
                    At the start of each inner loop in GBML, the model is functionally equivalent to a random initialization point, as <i>it has no prior knowledge of the new episode.</i> This initiates a learning trajectory similar to conventional deep learning, but with a critical distinction: GBML achieves this task-specific adaptation in typically fewer than three optimization steps, in contrast to the potentially countless steps in standard deep learning settings. GBML necessitates huge movements per step due to the constraint of very few optimization steps for task adaptation. This means <i>the Hessian is dominant</i> in the optimization, while in SGD it does not consider the Hessian.

                <div class="text-justify">
                    The equation above is the condition where the loss decreases. As SGD does not consider the Hessian, it becomes noise in the equation. However, in GBML, the Hessian is dominant in the inner loop as it moves a lot in a few steps.
                    From this perspective, we can deduce the conclusion that every successful GBML model should have a small Hessian size along the inner loop. And we hypothesize that this is what outer loop implicitly does.

                    Then our goal naturally becomes to explicitly suppress the Hessian along the inner loop. However, 
                    directly suppressing the Hessian is not favorable as it is computationally expensive. We solve this 
                    problem by observing that <b> the Hessian along the optimization trajectory</b> matters, not the Hessian itself.
                    Which means, we only need the Hessian in the direction of the optimization trajectory, which can be reduced in first order.
                    To do so, we provide ad-hoc measure. From the perspective of gradient flow, the model is less influenced by the Hessian
                    if it embodies more gradient steps and smaller learning rate. Therefore, minimizing the distance between the more-Hessian-influenced model
                    and less-Hessian-influenced model can be a measure the distortion by the Hessian. We call this measure as <b>SHOT</b>.
                    Then, the measure becomes a simple distance between the target and reference models.

                We trained the model with only SHOT loss. Which means, we did not use any target loss which aims to achieve meta-learning ability.
                As you can see, the randomly-initizlized model fails to learn the task. It is no better than random guess. However, SHOT-initialized model
                can perform better than random guess. The landscape explains why. The loss surface along the gradient direction is flat when we initialize 
                model with SHOT. Therefore, we can guarentee that the loss decreases along the gradient direction.
